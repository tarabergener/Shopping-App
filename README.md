# Overview

This program is designed to show the user recipes based on the ingredients they currently have in their home. They simply need to navigate to the Recipes page, press 'Search by Ingredients', type in the ingredients they have and hit search. The site will pull up applicable recipes with the ingredients they have in their home.

You can watch a demo of my program at: [RecipeFinder Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSSK_zzdaLk)
