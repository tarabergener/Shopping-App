    <h1>About Holly</h1>
    <image src="images/holly-ceo.jpg" alt="Holly - RecipeFinder CEO" width="400px"></image>
    <p>A homemaker in every sense of the word, Holly (RecipeFinder CEO), like many other mohters</p>
    <p>struggled with finding new recipes that were delicious and simple to make.</p>
    <p>We have all been there right? You get home from work at 5:00 pm, you look in</p>
    <p>the pantry and find nothing! Well, not nothing... a slew of ingredients you</p>
    <p>don't know what to do with. You're hungry, the kids are hungry, so what now?</p>
    <p>You eat out... again. The homemaker in you wants to spend all evening creating</p>
    <p>that piece of art that appeals to all the senses; it smells like heaven, and looks</p>
    <p>like it just popped off the cover of Taste of Home magazine! But instead you feel</p>
    <p>bad about being tired. You don't want to get back into the car to shop for extra</p>
    <p>ingredients and you don't know what to do with what you have...</p>
    <p>Well, look no further! This app was specifically designed for moms like Holly.</p>
    <p>Don't worry about the hassle of not getting your mobile shopping order done until</p>
    <p>tomorrow. Use what you have to make a delicious meal tonight!</p>
